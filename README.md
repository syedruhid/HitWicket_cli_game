# HitWicket_cli_game
This is  a turn based chess like game, a program that accepts commands to make moves over the cli (command line interface). This repository is developed for the purpose of submission and implementation of the game.


Step 1 : Initially created a layout.java file for the platfrom to play with 5x5 grid and 10 piece. The pieces are positioned similar to chess game.

Step 2: Create seperate abstract classes to inherit common characters for all the pieces. Every class will implement multilevel inheritance from this abstract class             defined.
